# Deploy the DAOS Cluster Example

## Overview

These instructions describe how to deploy a DAOS Cluster using the example in [terraform/examples/daos_cluster](../terraform/examples/daos_cluster).

Deployment tasks described in these instructions:

- Deploy a DAOS cluster using Terraform
- Perform DAOS administrative tasks to prepare the storage
- Mount a DAOS container with [DFuse (DAOS FUSE)](https://docs.daos.io/v2.0/user/filesystem/?h=dfuse#dfuse-daos-fuse)
- Store files in a DAOS container
- Unmount the container
- Remove the deployment (terraform destroy)

## Clone the repository

---

**Note about the "Open in Google Cloud Shell" button**

If you are viewing this content in Cloud Shell as a result of clicking on the "Open in Google Cloud Shell" button, you could skip this "Clone the repository" step since the repo will already be cloned for you when Cloud Shell opens.

However, it is not recommended to skip the "Clone the repository" step.

Each time you click on the "Open in Google Cloud Shell" button a new clone of the repo will be placed in the `~/cloudshell_open` directory. So, if you click the "Open in Google Cloud Shell" button three times you will end up with

```
~/cloudshell_open/
├── google-cloud-daos/
├── google-cloud-daos-0/
└── google-cloud-daos-1/
```

The DAOS cluster example in `terraform/examples/daos_cluster` does not store Terraform state in a central location such as a GCS bucket. The state will exist in the directory that you were in at the time you ran `terraform init` and `terraform apply`.

If you lose your Cloud Shell session before you are able to run `terraform destroy`, and you attempt to go back to where you were by clicking the "Open in Google Cloud Shell" button again, you will end up in a new clone of the repo that doesn't have the state for your deployed resources. Running `terraform destroy` in that new Cloud Shell session will fail. In order to run `terraform destroy` for the currently deployed resources, you will have to change your working directory to the `terraform/examples/daos_cluster` directory in the clone of the google-cloud-daos repo from your last Cloud Shell session.

This can get very confusing and when it happens it's not clear how to tear down your currently running DAOS cluster.

For this reason, it is recommended that if you are viewing this content as a result of clicking the "Open in Google Cloud Shell" button, it's best to complete this "Clone the repository" step and always run `terraform` from the same clone (`~/google-cloud-daos/terraform/examples/daos_cluster`) each time you open Cloud Shell.

---

Clone the [daos-stack/google-cloud-daos](https://github.com/daos-stack/google-cloud-daos) repository and change your working directory to the DAOS Cluster example directory.

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/daos-stack/google-cloud-daos.git
cd ~/google-cloud-daos/terraform/examples/daos_cluster
```

## Create a `terraform.tfvars` file

Before you run `terraform` you need to create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the `terraform/examples/daos_cluster` directory.

The `terraform.tfvars` file contains the variable values for the configuration.

To ensure a successful deployment of a DAOS cluster there are two pre-configured `terraform.tfvars.*.example` files that you can choose from.

You will need to decide which of these files to copy to `terraform.tfvars`.

### The terraform.tfvars.tco.example file

The `terraform.tfvars.tco.example` contains variables for a DAOS cluster deployment with
- 16 DAOS Client instances
- 4 DAOS Server instances

  Each server instance has sixteen 375GB NVMe SSDs

To use the `terraform.tfvars.tco.example` file

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.tco.example terraform.tfvars
```

### The terraform.tfvars.perf.example file

The `terraform.tfvars.perf.example` contains variables for a DAOS cluster deployment with
- 16 DAOS Client instances
- 4 DAOS Server instances

  Each server instances has four 375GB NVMe SSDs

To use the ```terraform.tfvars.perf.example``` file run

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.perf.example terraform.tfvars
```

### Update variables in `terraform.tfvars`

Now that you have a `terraform.tfvars` file you need to replace the variable placeholders in the file with the values from your active `gcloud` configuration.

To update the variables in `terraform.tfvars` run

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)')
REGION=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(compute.region)')
ZONE=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(compute.zone)')

sed -i "s/<project_id>/${PROJECT_ID}/g" terraform.tfvars
sed -i "s/<region>/${REGION}/g" terraform.tfvars
sed -i "s/<zone>/${ZONE}/g" terraform.tfvars
```

## Deploy the DAOS cluster

> **Billing Notification!**
>
> Running this example will incur charges in your project.
>
> To avoid surprises, be sure to monitor your costs associated with running this example.
>
> Don't forget to shut down the DAOS cluster with `terraform destroy` when you are finished.

To deploy the DAOS cluster

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
```

Verify that the daos-client and daos-server instances are running.

```bash
gcloud compute instances list \
  --filter="name ~ daos" \
  --format="value(name,INTERNAL_IP)"
```

Verify that the [Managed Instance Groups (MIGs)](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups) are stable.

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)')
ZONE=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(compute.zone)'

gcloud compute instance-groups managed wait-until 'daos-client' \
    --stable \
    --project="${PROJECT_ID}" \
    --zone="${ZONE}"

gcloud compute instance-groups managed wait-until 'daos-server' \
    --stable \
    --project="${PROJECT_ID}" \
    --zone="${ZONE}"
```

## Perform DAOS administration tasks

After your DAOS cluster has been deployed you can log into the first DAOS client instance to perform administrative tasks.

### Log into the first DAOS client instance

Log into the first client instance

```bash
gcloud compute ssh daos-client-0001
```

### Verify that all daos-server instances have joined

```bash
sudo dmg system query -v
```

The *State* column should display "Joined" for all servers.

```
Rank UUID                                 Control Address   Fault Domain      State  Reason
---- ----                                 ---------------   ------------      -----  ------

```

### Create a Pool

Check free NVMe storage.

```bash
sudo dmg storage query usage
```

From the output you can see there are 4 servers each with 1.6TB free. That means there is a total of 6.4TB free.

```
Hosts            SCM-Total SCM-Free SCM-Used NVMe-Total NVMe-Free NVMe-Used
-----            --------- -------- -------- ---------- --------- ---------
daos-server-0001 48 GB     48 GB    0 %      1.6 TB     1.6 TB    0 %
daos-server-0002 48 GB     48 GB    0 %      1.6 TB     1.6 TB    0 %
daos-server-0003 48 GB     48 GB    0 %      1.6 TB     1.6 TB    0 %
daos-server-0004 48 GB     48 GB    0 %      1.6 TB     1.6 TB    0 %
```

Create one pool that uses the entire 6.4TB.

```bash
sudo dmg pool create -z 6.4TB -t 3 --label=pool1
```

For more information about pools see

- [Overview - Storage Model - DAOS Pool](https://docs.daos.io/latest/overview/storage/#daos-pool)
- [Administration Guide - Pool Operations](https://docs.daos.io/latest/admin/pool_operations/)


## Create a Container

Create a [container](https://docs.daos.io/latest/overview/storage/#daos-container) in the pool

```bash
daos container create --type=POSIX --properties=rf:0 --label=cont1 pool1
```

For more information about containers see

- [Overview - Storage Model - DAOS Container](https://docs.daos.io/latest/overview/storage/#daos-container)
- [User Guide - Container Management](https://docs.daos.io/latest/user/container/?h=container)

## Mount the container

Mount the container with `dfuse`

```bash
MOUNT_DIR="${HOME}/daos/cont1"
mkdir -p "${MOUNT_DIR}"
dfuse --singlethread --pool=pool1 --container=cont1 --mountpoint="${MOUNT_DIR}"
df -h -t fuse.daos
```

You can now store files in the DAOS container mounted on `${HOME}/daos/cont1`.

For more information about DFuse see the [DAOS FUSE](https://docs.daos.io/latest/user/filesystem/?h=dfuse#dfuse-daos-fuse) section of the [User Guide](https://docs.daos.io/latest/user/workflow/).

## Use the Storage

The `cont1` container is now mounted on `${HOME}/daos/cont1`

Create a 20GiB file which will be stored in the DAOS filesystem.

```bash
cd ${HOME}/daos/cont1
time LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libioil.so \
  dd if=/dev/zero of=./test21G.img bs=1G count=20
```

## Unmount the container

```bash
cd ~/
fusermount -u ${HOME}/daos/cont1
```

## Remove DAOS cluster deployment

To destroy the DAOS cluster run

```bash
terraform destroy
```

This will shut down all DAOS server and client instances.

## Congratulations!

You have successfully deployed a DAOS cluster using the [terraform/examples/daos_cluster](../terraform/examples/daos_cluster) example!
