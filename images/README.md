# DAOS Images

This file describes how to build a DAOS client and server images

## Dependencies
We leverage cloud build and use a packer container image that we assume exists in your project.
If you have not build the Packer container image please do so now before continuing.

Please visit the tutorial [quickstart-packer](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/quickstart-packer).
You can leverage code from [cloud-builders-community](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community.git)
is the first step (the [packer folder](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/packer)).
You must have a packer docker container in your project in order for the rest of the scripts in this repository to work.


## Make a DAOS server image
Simply run the ```make_image.sh``` script. It will pick the pre-configured GCP project from gcloud.

To set your default project, run:
``` gcloud config set project <your project id>```
